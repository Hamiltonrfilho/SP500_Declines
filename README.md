**Disclaimer:** I'm not an economist, nor certified investors or someone professionally qualified to put in question the data integrity or the effects of this report on the markets, the whole purpose of this project is to put in practice my data analysis studies.

### 1. Executive Summary
---
The motivation of this project came about when listening to a Peter Lynch lecture from 1997. On said lecture, Lynch said: "I know we've had 96 years this century and the market's fallen 53 times, 53 declines of 10% or more, so 53 declines in 96 years, once every 2 years we have a 10% declines, 15 times 25% or more, so once every six years we have a decline of 25% or more, that is what we call a bear market". During my research I've found that Lynch said this in other lectures with slightly data variations(Earliest one I found was from 1994). Since then, a litte more than 20 years have passed, so I decided to see not just if the trends are the same, but also get a little bit deeper on the analysis.
